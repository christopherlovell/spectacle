# Spectacle

A module for generating spectra from cosmological simulations. Uses [schwimmbad](https://schwimmbad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for flexible parallelisation.


## Installation

First set the following environment variable in your `.bashrc` (or .cshrc) to the location of the cloned package:

    export SPECTACLE_HOME=/your/package/directory/spectacle


Then you can install using the `setup.py` script:

    python setup.py install
